def TimeBasedEventExecutor(events):
    '''Execute events after specific "times" have passed.

    Args:
        Events: List of 2- or 3- tuples. First item in each tuple is the time for each event, second item is the function to be executed for each event,
             third item (optional) is a string to be printed after the event function is executed.

    Returns:
        wait_and_excute: Function that can be called with signature wait_and_execute(t, *args), where `t` is the current "time" and `*args` are any argument
            to be passed to the event function. This function also have `extend` and `append` methods that allow for the event list to be grown.
